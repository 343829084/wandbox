* Prerequires

 - gcc >= 4.6
 - boost >= 1.47
 - libcap-dev
 - linux >= 3.2

 cattleshed can run on linux only.


* Build Cattleshed

 ~$ cd wandbox/cattleshed
 cattleshed$ ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --with-boost=$BOOSTDIR
 cattleshed$ make
 cattleshed$ sudo make install

 For more configuration options, see "./configure --help".
 You may need to run "autoreconf -i" before run "./configure" depending to
 versions of your autotools.
 cattleshed uses capabilities(7) and embed aux program path into binary so 
 cannot run without install.


* Prepare host environment

 - Create jail's working directory written in $PREFIX/etc/cattleshed.conf.
 - Create ran log directory written in $PREFIX/etc/cattleshed.conf.
 - Install compilers/runtimes/interpreters you want to provide via cattleshed.
 - Edit $PREFIX/etc/cattleshed.conf.d/compilers.default for your providing
   compilers/runtimes/interpreters.
 -- All files stored in cattleshed.conf.d are automatically globbed by
    cattleshed, so you can remove compilers.default and provide your
    configuration file split by Languages, Versions, etc.


* Run

 Run $PREFIX/bin/cattleshed as a user permitted to rwx to jails' working
 directory and ran log directory except root.

 DO NOT RUN CATTLESHED AS ROOT OR ALL YOUR SYSTEM WILL BELONG TO THE CRACKER.
